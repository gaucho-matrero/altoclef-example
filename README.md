# altoclef-example
Example Repository for making custom altoclef commands and tasks

# How to Develop/Use

1) Copy this repo/make a template repository
2) If you are using an IDE and its linting isn't working, run `gradle build` once (it should download altoclef dependencies and kick in from there)
3) run `gradle runClient`. Load into a world. Send the example command to verify the repo works (`@example`)
4) Use the examples to add your own custom commands and tasks.


# Task Development Stream: Common Edge cases/bugs to keep in mind!

1) Always implement `isEqual`!
2) Whenever going to the closest object, remember the ping pong movement issue (to approach one goal it gets closer to another)
    - Fix by committing to one (`_target = closest`, `if (target != null) {do to closest}`)
    - Use `DoToClosestBlockTask`/`DoToClosestEntityTask`
3) What if your target is surrounded in bedrock? If a block is unreachable/the bot fails to get there: Use `mod.getBlockTracker().unreachable(blockpos)`


# Coming Soon...
- Commands with arguments examples
- A task demonstrating each system that you may use with the bot.
