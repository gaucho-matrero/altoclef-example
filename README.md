# altoclef-example
Example Repository for making custom altoclef commands and tasks

# How to Develop/Use

1) Copy this repo/make a template repository
2) If you are using an IDE and its linting isn't working, run `gradle build` once (it should download altoclef dependencies and kick in from there)
3) run `gradle runClient` and run the example command to verify the repo works (`@example`)
4) Use the examples to add your own custom commands and tasks.


# Coming Soon...
- Commands with arguments examples
- A task demonstrating each system that you may use with the bot.
